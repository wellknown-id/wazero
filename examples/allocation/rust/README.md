## Rust allocation example

This directory contains the Rust guest fixture used for passing strings in and
out of a Wasm function defined in Rust, built with
`cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

Under the covers, [lib.rs](testdata/src/lib.rs) does a few things of interest:
* Uses a WebAssembly-tuned memory allocator: [wee_alloc](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc).
* Exports wrapper functions to allocate and deallocate memory.
* Uses `&str` instead of CString (NUL-terminated strings).
* Uses `std::mem::forget` to prevent Rust from eagerly freeing pointers returned.

Note: We chose to not use CString because it keeps the example similar to how
you would track memory for arbitrary blobs. We also watched function signatures
carefully as Rust compiles different WebAssembly signatures depending on the
input type.
